<!--Johnathan or TA reviewing this:
if you know a better way to do the inline styling for the text please let me know! (also purple was the only color that showed up well)
This was the best I could come up with for that, but am open to suggestions for future assignments-->

          <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
          <br>
          <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
            for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
            to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browse or
            Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmtic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
              the cup holds the coffee, a vriable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
              These unique names are called identifiers.<div class="inlinecolor">var x;</div> </li>
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee
              poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<div class="inlinecolor">var x=10</div></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Data Types</a> Date types are an eimportant concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                There are size data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<div class="inlinecolor">true</div> or <div class="inlinecolor">false;</div> null - <div class="inlinecolor">null</div>
                aka nothing; Number - <div class="inlinecolor">42</div> or <div class="inlinecolor">3.14159</div>; String - <div class="inlinecolor">"Coding Dojo Rocks!;"</div>Array - <div class="inlinecolor">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</div>
                and Object - <div class="inlinecolor">{first_name; 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</div></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different
                code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                statements: <div class="inlinecolor">if</div> a specified conditions is true, do this code in our code block; <div class="inlinecolor">else if</div> to specify a new condition to test,
                if the first condition is false; <div class="inlinecolor">else</div> we execute this block of code;
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they
                will repeatan action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
              <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulations of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.
                Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw
                the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
                over and over and over again.
