            <h3> What Are Databases?<h3>
            <h4> A structured set of data</h4>
            <p> Database are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a non-relational database.
              Relations means a set of our data is related to anoter section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database there is not a common related section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data called shcemas, inside each schema each data set is organized into tables
              those tables contain columns and rows to house that piticular set of data.

            <h3> Storage </h3>
            <img src="harddrive.jpg" alt="harddrive" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p> All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your harddrive, other times large companies will have floors upon floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information on the harddrive, we are able to create
            new information , read information, update information, and delete information.

            <h3> Searching </h3>
            <img src="database-search.jpg" alt="Searching" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p> Since there could potentally be a lot of information a database stores one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking. Imagine we had a room full of book and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Alborithm Book. Well you might start picking up each book
            checking the title and moving onto the next until you found it. Thats very slow as most libraries discovered. Instead if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly.

            <h3> Interaction </h3>
            <img src="dbinteraction.png" alt="DBInteraction" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p> The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well if only one user had access to that data its just like what we have built into our own computer, it wouldnt be userful to other users. However the joy of having a database
            is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleting information that all users would see.

            <img src="database-companies.jpg" alt="DBCompanies" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p> There are a lot of large companies that specilize in the storing of information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being incredible DB is completely free of cost and is used by a large company called Facebook.
